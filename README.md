Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a malware analysis environment. The environment is designed to enable both static and dynamic analysis of malware samples without risking contamination of your network.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

VirtualBox installed
Windows 10 ISO file
Basic understanding of malware analysis and cybersecurity
Setup
1. Install VirtualBox
Download and install VirtualBox.

2. Download Windows 10 ISO
Obtain a Windows 10 ISO file for installation.

3. Create and Configure Virtual Machine
Create a New VM:

Open VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine.
Attach the Windows 10 ISO file to the VM.
Configure Windows Settings:

Install Windows 10 on the VM.
Disable Windows Updates: Prevent automatic updates during analysis.
Disable Windows Defender: Preferably via Group Policy:
Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
Set Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus to Enabled.
Disable Tamper Protection:
Open Windows Security settings.
Go to Virus & threat protection.
Click on Manage settings under Virus & threat protection settings.
Toggle off Tamper Protection.
4. Install FLARE-VM Inside the Virtual Machine
Download FLARE-VM:

Inside the Windows 10 VM, visit the FLARE-VM GitHub page.
Run the FLARE-VM Installation:

Follow the instructions provided on the FLARE-VM GitHub page to install FLARE-VM inside the VM.
FLARE-VM uses Chocolatey and Boxstarter for managing and automating software installations.
Ensure tools such as FakeNet, HashMyFiles, Regshot, and Ghidra are installed as part of the FLARE-VM setup.
System Requirements for FLARE-VM:

Disk Capacity: At least 60 GB
Memory: At least 2 GB
Tools and Configuration
FakeNet: For simulating network services.
HashMyFiles: For calculating hash values of files.
Regshot: For taking snapshots of the registry before and after modifications.
Ghidra: A reverse engineering tool for analyzing binaries.
Ensure these tools are correctly installed and configured as part of the FLARE-VM setup.

Network Configuration
During Malware Analysis:
Set the VM network type to "Host-only" to isolate the VM from the external network and prevent any potential malware from affecting your network.
For Other Activities:
You may switch the network type to other configurations as needed, but ensure to revert to "Host-only" before performing malware analysis.
Analysis Procedures
Both static and dynamic malware analysis can be conducted within this controlled environment. Follow best practices for malware analysis to avoid unintended consequences.
